This folder contains animation scenes and libraries. The idea is to build a
template scene and animate the root node, or place whatever object you mean to
animate at the root and put the animation player as a child.

This allows us to save animation libraries and add them to other objects to
easily reuse those animations. If we need to make adjustments, then we can have
a good base to start from and save a new animation library for the adjustment.
